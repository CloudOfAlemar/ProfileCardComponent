### What I learned

Hello everyone, here is my solution to the Profile Card Component challenge from Frontend Mentor. The most challenging part was adding those background circles without letting the page scroll. I used overflow: hidden; but I think maybe google dev tools is buggy. Either way I completed the challenge and I'm on to the next one :D
